# Drumbo

_In-Browser Drum Machine App_

## Setup

To use this boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on Github and clone it to your local machine)
* Run the following commands:

```
git remote add boilermaker https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker.git
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

Why did we do that? Because every once in a while, `boilermaker` may be updated with additional features or bug fixes, and you can easily get those changes from now on by entering:

```
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

## Customize

Now that you've got the code, follow these steps to get acclimated:

* Update project name and description in `package.json` and `.travis.yml` files
* `npm install`, or `yarn install` - whatever you're into
* Create two postgres databases: `boilermaker` and `boilermaker-test` (you can substitute these with the name of your own application - just be sure to go through and change the `package.json` and `.travis.yml` to refer to the new name)
  * By default, running `npm test` will use `boilermaker-test`, while regular development uses `boilermaker`
* Create a file called `secrets.js` in the project root

  * This file is `.gitignore`'d, and will _only_ be required in your _development_ environment
  * Its purpose is to attach the secret env variables that you'll use while developing
  * However, it's **very** important that you **not** push it to Github! Otherwise, _prying eyes_ will find your secret API keys!
  * It might look like this:

  ```
    process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 'hush hush'
    process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = 'pretty secret'
    process.env.GOOGLE_CALLBACK = '/auth/google/callback'
  ```

* To use OAuth with Google, complete the step above with a real client ID and client secret from Google
  * You can get them here: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
* Finally, complete the section below to set up your linter
